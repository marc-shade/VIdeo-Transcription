## Features

- **Client Management**: Add, edit, view, and delete client profiles with a straightforward CRM interface.
- **Video Transcription**: Transcribe audio from video files using OpenAI's Whisper model, with optional timestamp inclusion.
- **Language Translation**: Translate transcriptions to multiple languages with Google Translate integration.
- **Bulk Import**: Process single video files or entire directories of videos.
- **Export Options**: Download selected or bulk transcription results in a text format.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Virtual Environment** (recommended): Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marc-shade/Video-Transcription.git
cd Video-Transcription
```

### Install Dependencies

Use the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The requirements include:
- `streamlit`: For the web interface.
- `whisper`: For transcription using OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model.
- `moviepy`: To handle video and audio extraction.
- `googletrans`: For translating transcriptions to multiple languages.
- `sqlite3`: For database management.

### Database Initialization

The application will create a SQLite database (`transcription.db`) if it does not exist. This database will store client information and transcription data.

## Usage

To start the application, run:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This command will open a new browser window with the application interface. Follow the instructions below to interact with the app.

### Basic Workflow

1. **Client Management**:
   - Navigate to **Client Management** from the sidebar.
   - Add new clients or edit existing client profiles.
   - View, manage, and delete client transcriptions as needed.

2. **Transcription Service**:
   - Select an existing client from the dropdown or add a new client if none exist.
   - Upload a video file for transcription (supported formats: `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.mkv`, `.wmv`).
   - Choose optional settings such as timestamp inclusion and translation language.
   - Start the transcription process and view progress.
   - Download the generated transcription as a `.txt` file.

3. **Bulk Directory Import**:
   - For batch processing, input the path to a directory containing multiple video files.
   - Process the entire directory in one go, with individual progress tracking for each file.
